# 1. Installation:

There should be no need to install any libraries to run the code here, except the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with Python versions 3.*.

# 2. Project Motivation:

This project involves analyzing a dataset that contains record from 100k medical appointments in Brazil to help in investigating the reasons that makes a patient miss their prescheduled appointment. This project aims to lead to some solutions to the problematic issue that they are facing.

# 3. File Descriptions:

A csv file containes all data used in this analysis is provided.
There is also a notebook available here that shows all my work.

# 4. Results:

The main findings of the analysis can be found here permalink: https://medium.com/@byooon1990/what-make-patients-show-up-not-show-up-to-their-pre-scheduled-appointment-2d85c9bc29e6
